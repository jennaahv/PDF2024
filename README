Three of us brainstormed on a project idea. We had a few different ideas but landed on a sound level meter that shows when the dB-level in a room goes too high. We talked about the different design possibilities and use cases, such as class rooms, construction sites etc. We prepared our slides for the presentation on Wednesday. We also chose our roles for the project.
